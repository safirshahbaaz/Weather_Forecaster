## Scope for Improvement
Right now, the HTTP request happens on the client side to get the weather information. Ideally, the client code should send a HTTP request to a server which in turn executes an API call to get the required information. Once the information is received, the server sends the information back to client for parsing and presentation. This would be the next step to take once sufficient background knowledge is developed on NodeJS.
